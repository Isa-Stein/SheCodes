# SheCodes - Weather APP
As the final project for the Shecodes Bootcamp I was asked to develop a weather App.
Here you will find my code files for HTML,CSS and JS. 

It is fantastic to see how code evolves and how a few simple lines can have a big impact on what is being created!

I hope you enjoy.
