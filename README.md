#SheCodes Project

For this project I was asked to build a weather app throughout my SheCodes course.
As the weeks progressed and I learnt more techniques and explored languages my code evolved. 
It is fantastic to see how powerful a few lines of code are!!

This project uses CSS, HTML  and JavaScript.
